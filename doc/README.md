- [Motivation and Project Goals](../doc/CORTX-Motivation&Goals.md)


## CORTX Community Values 

-   **Inclusive** - Our ambitions are global. The CORTX community is, too. The perspectives and skills necessary to achieve our goals are wide and varied; we believe in creating a community and a project that is inclusive, accessible, and welcoming to everyone.
-   **Open** - We are dedicated to remaining open and transparent. We believe in keeping CORTX Community code freely and fully available to be viewed, modified, and used without vendor lock-in or other in-built limitations.
-   **Inspired** - CORTX is all about the challenge. Our goals are not small: we want to build the world’s best scalable mass-capacity object storage system, one that can work with any hardware and interoperate with all workloads. CORTX is built on hard work, ingenuity, and an engineering mindset. We embrace hard problems and find inspired solutions.
-   **Evolving** – CORTX is continuously growing and adapting. As a community project, there is no limit to its development. We continuously make room for improvement and welcome the opportunities offered by the ever-evolving nature of community projects.

We are excited about your interest in CORTX and hope you will join us. We take our community very seriously, and we are committed to creating a community built on respectful interactions and inclusivity, as documented in our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  Because of our commitment to community, we work hard to track important community metrics; please feel free to check out how we do it and help us do it better in our [metrics folder](metrics).  We also publish our [Community Roadmap](Community_Roadmap.md); please let us know what other community events and milestones you would like to see.

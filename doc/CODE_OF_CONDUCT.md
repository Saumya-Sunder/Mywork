# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting
 
## Our Community Values 

-   **Inclusive** - Our ambitions are global. The CORTX community is, too. The perspectives and skills necessary to achieve our goals are wide and varied; we believe in creating a community and a project that is inclusive, accessible, and welcoming to everyone.
-   **Open** - We are dedicated to remaining open and transparent. We believe in keeping CORTX Community code freely and fully available to be viewed, modified, and used without vendor lock-in or other in-built limitations.
-   **Inspired** - CORTX is all about the challenge. Our goals are not small: we want to build the world’s best scalable mass-capacity object storage system, one that can work with any hardware and interoperate with all workloads. CORTX is built on hard work, ingenuity, and an engineering mindset. We embrace hard problems and find inspired solutions.
-   **Evolving** – CORTX is continuously growing and adapting. As a community project, there is no limit to its development. We continuously make room for improvement and welcome the opportunities offered by the ever-evolving nature of community projects.

We are excited about your interest in CORTX and hope you will join us. We take our community very seriously, and we are committed to creating a community built on respectful interactions and inclusivity, as documented in our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  Because of our commitment to community, we work hard to track important community metrics; please feel free to check out how we do it and help us do it better in our [metrics folder](metrics).  We also publish our [Community Roadmap](Community_Roadmap.md); please let us know what other community events and milestones you would like to see.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at opensource@seagate.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

# CORTX: World's Only 100% Open Source Mass-Capacity Optimized Object Store

The amount of data the world is creating and collecting is increasing massively. The amount of data the world is storing is not. The models and machine learning that are at the forefront of some of the most important research today depend on access to compete data sets, but limitations on storage lead to unnecessary data loss. By creating better, more economical storage solutions, we enable the research that is changing the world.

## The CORTX Project

CORTX is a distributed object storage system designed for great efficiency, massive capacity, and high HDD-utilization.  **CORTX is 100% Open Source.** Most of the project is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](../main/LICENSE) and the rest is under AGPLv3; check the specific License file for each submodule to determine which is which.

### CORTX Project Scope & Core Design Goals

| Project Scope      | Core Design Goals                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mass capacity | Object storage uniquely optimized for mass capacity storage devices       .                                                                                                       |
| Processor agnostic | Works with any processor.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Flexibility        | Highly flexible, works with HDD, SSD, and NVM.                                                                                                                                   |
| Scalability        | Massively Scalable. Scales up to a billion billion billion billion billion exabytes (2^206) and 1.3 billion billion billion billion (2^120) objects with unlimited object sizes. |
| Responsiveness     | Rapidly Responsive. Quickly retrieves data regardless of the scale using a novel Key-Value System that ensures low search latency across massive data sets.                      |
| Resilience         | Highly Resilient. Ensures a high tolerance for hardware failure and faster rebuild and recovery times using Network Erasure Coding, while remaining fully RAID-compatible.       |
| Transparency       | Provides specialized telemetry data and unmatched insight into system performance.                                                                                               |

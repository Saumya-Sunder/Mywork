# Security

We take the security of our CORTX project seriously, which includes all our source code repositories managed through our [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/Seagate).

If you find any security vulnerabilities in any of the CORTX-owned repositories that meet the definition of a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**TODO** Add an article that identifies and lists out security vulnerabilities within the project and provide the link here. 

## Reporting Security Issues

:warning: **Please do not report any security vulnerabilities via GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to [opensource@seagate.com](mailto:opensource@seagate.com). 

**TODO** Add a method to encrypt the mail. 

### Reporting Format

We've listed the basic information required to report a security vulnerability. This is not an exhaustive list, please include as much information as you can to help us understad the nature and scope of the vulnerability of the reported issue:

  * Issue type 
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

If you are reporting for a bug bounty, more complete reports can contribute to a higher bounty award. Please visit our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://microsoft.com/msrc/bounty) page for more details about our active programs.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

Microsoft follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/cvd).

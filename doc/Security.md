# Security

We take the security of the CORTX project seriously. If you find any [security vulnerabilities] *Link placeholder* in any of the CORTX-owned source code managed via our [GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/Seagate) repositories, please report it to us as [described below](#Reporting-Security-Issues).

**TODO** Add an article that identifies and lists out security vulnerabilities within the project and provide the link here. 

## Reporting Security Issues

:warning: **Please do not publicly report any security vulnerabilities via GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to us by mailing us at [opensource@seagate.com](mailto:opensource@seagate.com). 

**TODO** Add a method to encrypt the mail. 

#### Reporting Format

To make your reporting meaningful and help us understand the nature and scope of the issue, please include the following information. This is not an exhaustive list, please include as much information as you can:

  * Issue type

  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)

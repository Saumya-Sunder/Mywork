# CORTX-Web

Cloud Storage Manager (CSM) is a virtualization layer that lets you configure & provisionâ€”storage, manage users, set policies, and gain insights through reports. The CSM is made up of the Agent and Web components. The CSM-Web component is a UI based application that lets you configure, manage, and monitor all the backend components of the CORTX application. The CSM-Web sits on top of the CSM agent. The CSM-Agent is a backend application that bridges the CSM-Web with all other CORTX backend components, thus establishing a two-way communication among them.
